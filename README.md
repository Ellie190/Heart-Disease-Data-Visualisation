# Heart-Disease-Data-Visualisation
R Shiny Dashboard for visualizing the heart disease data set 

## Indicators 
`What is an indicator?`: A thing that indicates the state or level of something. E.g., Chest pain is used as an indicator for heart disease. 

## Comparison of Patient Indicators 
- This section helps answer the question: `How does the classes/symptoms of the heart disease indicators vary in numbers/percentage according to patients that are heart disease positive or negative?`
- The positive legend is an indication of heart disease. If a patient has heart disease then it is `Yes` and if a patient does not have heart disease then it is `No`.
- This can inform on how symptoms vary in numbers based on the population examined for heart disease. E.g., from the figure below, it is evident that most patients that exhibit `Typical angina` for `Chest pain type` do not have heart disease (green). 
- The guage displays the percentage of patients that have heart disease from the population examined. In this case, 54% of the patients have heart disease.
- The user can filter through the indicators for different results.

## Distribution of Patient Indicators
- This section helps answer the question: `How are the measurable/numerical indicators distributed according to patients that have heart disease and patients that do not heart disease?`
- This can inform on the likely ranges the measurable/numerical indicators take for patients that have heart disease and patients that do not heart disease. 
- This provides a statistical summary of the measurable/numerical indicators.

## Relationship between Patient Indicators 
- This section helps answer the question(s): `What relationship does the indicators have with one anaother?`
- This can also inform correlation and outliers present in the data captured from patients examined for heart disease.
